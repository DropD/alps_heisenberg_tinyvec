# TODOS

## Overall
* ~~capitalize first letter of headlines (with exceptions) [OK]~~

## Simulation Class
* ~~first code example highlights fraction_completed() instead of measure() as written in the text. [OK]~~
* ~~Third but last paragraph: "For the update step we will pick a random spin potential new direction vector for it." is there an "and" missing? [OK]~~
* ~~Second but last paragraph: "[...] and will tell us together [...]" - will tell us what? [OK]~~

## The measure() function
* ~~First sentence: weird English "In this example we target quantities will be energy[...]" [OK]~~
* ~~"stands for averaging with respect to time.", I would not call it "time", as Monte Carlo doesn't provide a notion of time. It is just a statistical average over the samples. [OK]~~

## using python with ALPS
* ~~You use a hybrid python-command-line approach when you create the parameter input. Could you do this purely in python using pyalps? You can have a look at mc-03-magnetization/tutorial3a.py. [OK]~~
* ~~Test solution [OK]~~

## Results
* Could you write a short interpretation of the results and maybe some comparison with literature?
